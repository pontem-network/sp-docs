# Wallet Demo

We prepared two demos: one with a wallet adapter and another one just using native Pontem Wallet integration.

![Pontem Wallet Demo](/assets/demo.png "Pontem Wallet Demo")

It contains basic features like:

* Choose wallet to connect
* Connect wallet
* Show address
* Sign transaction

But still good enough for a good start with Pontem Wallet and Wallet Adapter.

Try demo using the following links:

The source code for the demo is available on our Github - [Pontem Wallet Demo Github](https://github.com/pontem-network/pontem-wallet-demo)
