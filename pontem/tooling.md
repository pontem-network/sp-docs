# Tooling & Functionality

![Toolset](/assets/illustrations/tooling.png "Toolset")

As with any blockchain Pontem will come with standard tooling and functionality that end users are familiar with, _however we aim to augment these tools to better suit the needs of the Pontem blockchain._

# No-code Tools

Check out the **[LIVE DEMO](https://www.figma.com/proto/Kx0rTu2qMYJVkWiGK9b5iK/Pontem-Blocks-Public-Prototype?node-id=2079%3A13295&viewport=659%2C252%2C0.033419206738471985&scaling=scale-down)**.

With the advent of user-friendly decentralized exchanges and DeFi Dapps such as [1inch Exchange](https://1inch.exchange/) and [Furucombo](https://furucombo.app/) which take complex multi-hop transactions and combine them into one transaction, users have become increasingly accustomed to simple interfaces for executing complex trades.

🧙‍♂️ This is the concept that the No-Code tools on Pontem builds on in order to allow people without coding skills to:

* Create smart contracts
* Add Liquidity to Swap platforms
* Deploy Staking Contracts
* Create new DeFi farming strategies
* Execute Loan/Borrow operations
{% endhint %}

These tools are limitless. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Any developer can publish their own Move module and create a No-Code block to be used by others.
{% endhint %}

Pontem is **one-stop marketplace** for executing No-Code transactions across a number of different use cases. The added benefit is that developers **can choose to charge** for their No-Code blocks per execution.
