{% hint style="info" %}
🚀 Pontem is a bridge between the regulated and unregulated worlds that will allow exchanging value between the two. It is backed by Wings Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit foundation established in 2016.

**Pontem** is an Experimental Network for **Diem**.

We aim to enable an experimentation testnet that will leverage the best aspects of Diem technology and the Move programming language in order to speed up use case development. Pontem will also be the first project of its kind to bring the [Move VM](../move_vm/README.md) and [Move Language](../lang/README.md) to Polkadot via the Pontem Parachain.

We believe that by doing this:

Projects will gain early-alignment to the Diem architecture and technology stack.
It will also speed up their go-to-market strategy if they are chosen to be onboarded into the Diem ecosystem and granted access to Diem's 2 billion+ userbase.

## Why Pontem?

Today, more than ever, we are standing at a divide between two crypto worlds — the regulated and the unregulated. 

While the unregulated world grew rapidly, often chaotically, the regulated one has always been a kind of a closed garden, available only to the chosen ones. _This has led to segregation in the society that hasn’t yet been addressed, with those who are able to enjoy the benefits of the blockchain world being able to utilize it to the fullest, and those who do not have the means to are locked in the closed garden._

Furthermore, the launch of Diem has been impacted by several factors which limits the initial use cases for Diem, these factors being:

* **Regulators' concern** with Facebook's power
* Diem **threatened** national currencies on launch
* Governments are now closely **monitoring** and **scrutinizing** Diem from a legal standpoint

We decided to change this once and for all by launching Pontem, **a place where the regulated world meets the unregulated**. Pontem will help Diem users gain access to all the use-cases provided by the unregulated society, such as financial instruments, security tools, and even games.

Pontem Network is a solution that will answer the demand of different markets and individuals:

* Introduce creators to Diem's potential
* Enable experimentation and value discovery
* Validate ideas before submission to Diem
* Provide value exchange with Diem
* Support user traction loop from Diem.
